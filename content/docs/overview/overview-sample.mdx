title: Overview Sample
description: Example page that appears under the Overview section.
---

Welcome to the Overview section. This is a sample MDX page to show how entries appear under **Overview** in the sidebar.

## Quick facts

- Files live in `content/docs`.
- Regular MDX pages show under **Overview**.
- OpenAPI-generated pages are grouped separately under **Unified REST API**.

## Example code

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Next steps

Add more pages or folders under `content/docs` to build out your Overview content structure.
