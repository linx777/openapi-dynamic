# Architecture Overview

Use this section to describe system design, components, and diagrams.

## Why this folder?

- Everything under `content/docs/architecture` is grouped under **Architecture**.
- The folder appears after **Overview** and before **Unified REST API** in the sidebar.

## Next steps

- Add more MDX files in this folder (e.g., `components.mdx`, `data-flow.mdx`).
- Keep API reference content in Unified REST API.
