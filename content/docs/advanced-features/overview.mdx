# Advanced Features

Use this area to document deeper capabilities, flags, and tuning options.

## Highlights

- Lives in `content/docs/advanced-features`.
- Appears after **Architecture** and before **Strategy Engine** in the sidebar.
- Keep API references in **Unified REST API**.

## Example snippet

```ts
type FeatureToggle = 'beta' | 'experimental' | 'stable';

export function isFeatureEnabled(toggle: FeatureToggle) {
  return toggle !== 'experimental';
}
```
