# Strategy Engine

Document decision logic, orchestration flows, and how strategies are evaluated.

## Highlights

- Lives in `content/docs/strategy-engine`.
- Appears after **Advanced Features** and before **Unified REST API** in the sidebar.
- Great place for diagrams, timelines, and execution details.

## Example snippet

```ts
type StrategyInput = { signal: number; threshold: number };

export function shouldExecute({ signal, threshold }: StrategyInput) {
  return signal >= threshold;
}
```
